I contributed with most of the CSS to the pages. I worked well with my group members and was there when they needed me. Also communicated it a mannerable time. 

Diana: She contributed with the HTML portion. She also corrected the errors that showed when we validated the the pages. She communicated very well and was there to support in anything.
Karen: She contributed with the HTML portion as well. She made sure the pages had no errors. Also was there to help with anything else. 
Tenzin: She also contributed with the HTML. Also added the javascript to the buttons. She made sure the requirements were all made.
